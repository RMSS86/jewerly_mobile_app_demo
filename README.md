# Jewelry demo App
```This demo app is based on an existing app prototype and registered brand. ```

Please feel free to create your own version of this app, make sure to replace all assets for yours to prevent copyright issues,
Also feel free to implement ARKit for iOS if required and the 3D assets used on this demo aren't mine; both were taken from www.sketchfab.com
for compatibility purposes make sure to update Flutter / Gradle version accordingly, check out the pubspec.yaml for details
